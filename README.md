## Objective 

Today's autism diagnosis is a quite lengthy and inefficient process. Families often have to wait a few years before receiving a diagnosis, and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the earliest possible intervention is required for best clinical outcomes. One of the biggest indicators of autism is self-stimulatory, or stimming, behaviors such as hand flapping, headbanging, and spinning. In this paper, we demonstrate successful lightweight detection of hand flapping in videos using deep learning and activity recognition. We believe such methods will help create a remote, fast, and accessible autism diagnosis. 

## Data 

In order to collect the videos, we use the [Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD)](https://rolandgoecke.net/research/datasets/ssbd/) which contains 75 videos of hand flapping, head banging, and spinning behavior. We extract 100 hand flapping and control 2-3 second videos from this dataset and use it 
to train our model. Because most of the videos in SSBD are children, we wanted to see whether a model we built could generalize past age (and hand shape), so we recorded 3 positive and 3 control videos of ourselves. 

Our entire dataset can be found in a google drive folder [here](https://tinyurl.com/47fya6).
